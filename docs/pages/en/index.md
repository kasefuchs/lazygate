## :material-magnify: What is LazyGate?

**LazyGate** is a [Gate proxy](https://github.com/minekube/gate) plugin that automatically shuts down your Minecraft server when it’s idle and starts it again when players connect.

Some Minecraft servers, especially modded ones, use a huge amount of resources even when nobody is playing. LazyGate helps save resources by stopping the backend server during idle periods and waking it up automatically when a player tries to join.

As a Gate plugin, LazyGate runs inside the proxy and intercepts incoming connection attempts. When the backend server is offline, it starts it up and then seamlessly transfers the player once it’s ready, all without them noticing.
